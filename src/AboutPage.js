        I am an experienced Full Stack Developer with a passion for media in many different forms. I love reading, watching movies and playing games. If you leave me alone long enough you will probably find me doing one of those things. I also love solving problems. The experience of looking at a problem, breaking it down and solving it piece by piece has always been rewarding and enjoyable. I also love to challenge myself so I constantly look for ways to improve my code and skills at every oppurtunity.
